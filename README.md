# fraud-detection-for-credit-card
Fraud Detection for Credit Card👨‍💻 using linear regression. It is a critical area of financial security to identify fraudulent credit card transactions before they cause significant financial damage. We will employ a logistic regression model, a common choice for binary classification tasks like fraud detection.

1). Data Loading and Exploration:
---->Load the dataset containing credit card transactions.
---->Explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents using Pandas.
2). Data Preprocessing:
---->Perform necessary preprocessing steps such as scaling numerical features and encoding categorical variables if any.
3). Model Building:
---->Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split from Scikit-Learn.
---->Build a logistic regression model using LogisticRegression from Scikit-Learn.
---->Train the model on the training set.

Tools Used:
#Python Libraries: Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib for data visualization.
#Scikit-Learn: For machine learning tasks such as model building, evaluation, and preprocessing.

These techniques to safeguard financial transactions. By leveraging historical data and employing logistic regression, we can effectively detect fraudulent activities and mitigate potential losses for credit card companies and their customers.
